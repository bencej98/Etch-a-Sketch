# Etch-a-Sketch

## Project Description:

This project was created as part of The Odin Project course. I have built the project fully by myself starting from scratch.

The aim of this project is to have fun with the game and draw anything you like.

The game is hosted with github pages and you can visit is via this link: https://bencej98.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/

## Tech Stack:

JavaScript\
HTML\
CSS

## Usage:

The usage of the game is fairly simple. When you arrive to the page you will see an empty grid where you can start drawing after you chose a color of your choice.


### Picking a color: 
You can pick any color by clicking on the color picker which is located on the top next to the grid.

### Setting grid size:
You can set the grid size by using the slider and above the slider you can also see the current size of the grid.

### "Reset" button:
Clicking this button will set back the grid to it's initial stage and will delete any drawing from it.

### "Black" button:
Clicking this button will set the current color to black.

### "Rainbow" button:
Clicking this button will activate a so-called "rainbow" mode which means that upon entering a new block the color changes to a random one thus you can create rainbow-like drawings.

### "Eraser" button:
Clicking this button will set the current mode to eraser which you can use to clear the whole board. It is like using an eraser in school to clear the white board.

## Structure of the game:

For the creation if this game I used vanilla JavaScript to learn every bit of the language before using any framework.

Other than that I created the style and structure of it using HTML and CSS.

## Future Development:

I am planning to add a button to the page where you can toggle the block border and draw to a completely white board if you choose to.

## Struggles/Summary:

As this is my second project using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS some of the concepts were easier to use but I have encountered CSS variables which I had to learn. Also there is a fairly good amount of DOM manipulation in the project and this concept needed some research.\

Creating this game was the perfect opportunity for me to learn even more about JavaScript.
